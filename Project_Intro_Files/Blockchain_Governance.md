Governance is a term that relates to decision making processes within an organization — who is responsible for what, how are major decisions being taken or implemented, is authority vested in a select few or distributed among all participants, etc. A successful governance model is usually what makes an organization click. Logically, there is no one-size-fits-all here — every model is situational and its viability largely depends on the specific circumstances. While a participative democracy could work for some, having powers vested in a central authority may be preferable for others. Though as diverse as they may be, exemplary governance models are often centered around a set of qualities: transparency, integrity, effective performance and collaboration.
In the context of blockchain, the discussion on governance currently revolves around two sets of models: centralized vs. decentralized and on-chain vs. off-chain. The first duel is the classic blockchain paradox which calls into question contemporary authority structures. The second refers to human involvement and the extent to which decision making processes are automated.
Regardless of the governance structure, matters at stake typically involve- 
network access, funding allocation, block size, reward systems, voting and decision making (e.g. reversing transactions via a fork).

Blockchain’s main value proposition is decentralization— eliminating gatekeepers or middle-men in transactions to reduce costs and enabling parties to directly transact with each other, e.g. via smart contracts. On a large scale, this effectively means the removal of centers of authority such as governments and their institutions, central banks, etc.

Decentralized governance is therefore a natural response to the current ‘State above all’ world order that has been the go-to approach for centuries. In the age of information and personal empowerment, decentralization acts as a driver towards a future designed to vest authority in the hands of the people. For this reason it could even considered to be the digital extension of a representative democracy. Decentralized networks are usually consensus driven and enable participants to take active part in decision making processes within a network. Just like in Bitcoin— whenever a transaction is queued, it requires the collective approval of inter-connected nodes to go through rather than that of a central operator or groups of such.

Centralized vs. Decentralized Governance

Decentralized governance is therefore a natural response to the current ‘State above all’ world order that has been the go-to approach for centuries. In the age of information and personal empowerment, decentralization acts as a driver towards a future designed to vest authority in the hands of the people. For this reason it could even considered to be the digital extension of a representative democracy.

Decentralized networks are usually consensus driven and enable participants to take active part in decision making processes within a network. Just like in Bitcoin — whenever a transaction is queued, it requires the collective approval of inter-connected nodes to go through rather than that of a central operator or groups of such. Besides the case for direct transacting and bypassing middlemen or gatekeepers, a decentralized governance model has the obvious benefit of providing checks and balances on those with authority, hence increased transparency and accountability.

Transaction approval has to go through a number of stakeholders and vote calls are usually made available for the whole network to see. A central authority is unable to ‘cook the books’ or introduce self-interest changes behind closed doors as the books are distributed among the participants. This also eliminates the risk of ‘Single Point of Failure’ of centralized systems.

Moreover, decentralization can help improve efficiency and the rate at which decisions are taken on the macro level. In line with the DASH example, specific decisions can be directly submitted and thereby bypass traditional hierarchical structures native to centralized governance models.


The benefit of a centralized governance model, assuming a responsible and knowledgeable authority is in charge, relates to the latter’s monopoly over decision making. Typically, a central authority will possess all relevant information to make informed decisions which serve the community’s best interests.

Furthermore, a single authority is usually more likely to possess the necessary expertise to ensure smooth operations and informed decisions. This is at least in an ideal scenario where the authority in question remains responsible towards its managing obligations. In such a complex environment like blockchain, centralized decision making will often be advocated for due to information asymmetries between central bodies and a network’s constituents. Given the fact that the central controller is probably the one who designed the network, it makes sense to vest authority in the creator.

Additionally, centralization could also have the benefit of faster decisions. As participation from others is reduced, a central body can execute faster without the need of subjecting every single decision to a combined vote. Having a pre-determined decision making process system will of course be an additional prerequisite to proper operations. The infamous DAO attack from 2016 with 3.6 million stolen Ethereum is a clear example of how slow decision making can have vast negative consequences on a network’s entire operability and functionality.

On-chain vs off-chain governance


On-chain governance is essentially a type of a decentralized governance models since it bears the feature of distributed decision making— nodes collectively vote and take decisions as opposed to having one central body in charge. Participation in voting processes is incentivized by on-chain rewards for the developers/nodes and leaves end users without a say when it comes to project management. Of course, the specific details on vote eligibility vary from one project to the other, but the main characteristic remains a code-based voting system for relevant stakeholders.

Off-chain systems of governance typically involve processes outside the blockchain or ‘code’ domain — only after having reached a decision, its implications are translated into on-chain action, such as for example a soft fork or investment allocation. Thus, this governance model makes use of pre-existing regulatory and compliance mechanisms to steer a blockchain network’s future

Bitcoin is the most prominent open-source blockchain network and most commonly used decentralized governance model example. Contrary to some opinions, the main decision makers within Bitcoin are the users and the miners, not the Bitcoin Core Development team or an active project lead such as Ethereum’s very own Vitalik Buterin.

It could very well be also argued that Bitcoin’s governance model is a mix between on- and off-chain governance, taking into account the role of community leaders outside the actual code.
